# Setting up Android Studio

I actually already tried this xd `Bitacora.md` have all my previous notes on installing AS. 

The problem I found before was that the VM I set up didnt have enough space. I am setting one with more space and I will try to run it again.

Meanwhile, there are some interesting commands to check the computer specifications in the course codelab.

- `lscpu` to check cpu info
- `free -m` to check total memory
- `df -h` to check disk space
- `xrandr | grep '*'` to check screen resolution

What comes next is basically whay I did in `Bitacora.md` so I will not write it here.

Actually, there is another interesting command. They decrompress the tar.gz with 

```Bash
tar -xzvf android-studio-2022.2.1.20-linux.tar.gz
```

instead of `-xf` which I originally used. I will use mine jeje
